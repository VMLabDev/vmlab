# vmlab-hv benchmarks (D2, D28)

The continuous benchmark suite that holds the phase gates: on TCG arches
(aarch64, riscv64) `vmlab-hv` with `accel: tcg` must reach at least 100 %
of QEMU TCG's speed on this host (D1, `notes/04-speed-bar.md`); on x86_64
KVM it must hold HV-D28 before the VM default flips (`notes/29-performance.md`):
boot to agent ready no slower than QEMU, virtio-blk and virtio-net at
least 80 % of QEMU's throughput. Tracked by a result history and a
regression check (D2). TCG baseline method and first numbers:
`notes/03-architecture-baseline.md`; the phase-2 gate verdicts live in
`bench/PHASE2-GATE.md`.

## Recipes

| Recipe | Does |
|---|---|
| `just bench-run backend='qemu' arch='all' vcpus='1,4' repeats='3' guest='debian-13'` | run the TCG suite, append to the history |
| `just bench-run-kvm backend='qemu' guest='ubuntu-26.04' repeats='3'` | run the x86_64 KVM suite (guest `ubuntu-26.04` or `windows-10`; vcpus defaults to the template's) |
| `just bench-run-g2g backend='qemu'` | the x86_64 guest-to-guest net pair (two VMs at once) |
| `just bench-report` | print the per-workload trend, and hv-vs-qemu against the phase's bar |
| `just bench-check` | fail (exit 1) if the latest run of a backend regressed beyond measured noise |
| `just bench-test` | the suite's own unit tests |

`bench-run` flags map 1:1 to `python3 bench/run.py` flags:
`--cpus PIN` overrides the taskset window, `--timeout-scale N` widens every
ceiling for a slow backend, `--keep` preserves per-run scratch, `--dry-run`
prints the plan without booting anything.

## Workloads

Per guest arch (aarch64, riscv64), per vCPU count (1 and 4), N repeats,
from the local vmlab templates (`~/.local/share/vmlab/templates/<arch>/`;
newest version dir; a fresh qcow2 overlay per repeat — the template is never
written):

1. **boot_to_agent_ready** — process spawn to the guest agent answering its
   Hello on `vmlab.agent.0`, dialed fresh every second exactly like vmlab's
   readiness poller (an early persistent connection's Hello is never
   answered; notes/03 §1).
2. **sha256_256M** — `sha256sum` over 256 MiB written by `dd` from
   `/dev/zero`; timed host-side through the agent's `open_exec`. The input is
   fixed, so the digest is asserted identical across repeats.
3. **xz_9_32M** — `xz -9 -T1` over 32 MiB of repeated text, timed the same
   way.


Every repeat also verifies the xz roundtrip (`cmp`) and that the guest
really sees the configured CPU count (`nproc`).

## x86_64 KVM workloads (phase 2, HV-D28)

Per guest template (ubuntu-26.04, windows-10 — the template's own vCPU
count and memory), N repeats, fresh qcow2 overlay per repeat:

1. **boot_to_agent_ready** — process spawn to vmlab's own readiness: the
   agent's answered Hello plus, for the sysprep-generalized windows
   template, both setup phases cleared and the first-boot reboot done
   (the gate vmlab's provision script applies). vmlab-hv exits cleanly on
   a guest reset, so the bench respawns it exactly as vmlab would; QEMU
   reboots in-process. The clock starts at the first spawn.
2. **blk_seq_read_mbps** — 1-MiB O_DIRECT reads over the template-backed
   overlay's allocated extent (`/dev/vda`), via bench/randblke.c copied in
   through the agent (the template ships no fio, and GNU dd's
   `iflag=direct` buffer is refused with EINVAL by the virtio-blk device).
3. **blk_seq_write_mbps** — 512 MiB of 1-MiB O_DIRECT writes with a final
   `fdatasync` inside the timed window, to a fresh file on the overlay.
4. **blk_rand_read_4k_iops** / **blk_rand_write_4k_iops** — 4-KiB O_DIRECT
   ops at fixed-seed random offsets (reads over the allocated extent,
   writes over a preallocated 1-GiB file).
5. **net_tx_udp_mbps** — the guest blasts 65 000-byte UDP payloads at the
   host peer for 12 s; the rate is what the peer received: guest →
   virtio-net → the backend's stream netdev → vmlab's 4-byte-big-endian
   framing → the unix socket. Delivery below 90 % of what the guest sent
   fails the repeat instead of recording a broken number.
6. **net_rx_udp_mbps** — the peer blasts the guest for 12 s; the rate is
   the guest interface's own `rx_bytes` delta (kernel-counted, immune to
   userspace starvation under the flood).
7. **net_g2g_a2b_tcp_mbps** / **net_g2g_b2a_tcp_mbps** (`--suite g2g`) —
   two VMs on one two-port hub (raw byte pump, the framing is
   transparent), real TCP between the guest stacks, both directions,
   receiver-side bytes.
8. **idle_cpu_pct** — host CPU (utime+stime of the whole VM process, all
   threads) over a 60 s idle window, as a percentage of one core.
   Reported against QEMU; D28 sets no bar for it.

Both sides measure ethernet-level bytes, and both carry the one forced
deviation: `host_mtu=65520` (jumbo frames keep the stdlib guest tools and
the framing peer off the measured ceiling). The windows-10 template runs
boot_to_agent_ready only.

## Backends (x86_64)

- **qemu** — vmlab's exact argv for the profile shape
  (`src/qemu/cmdline.rs build_args`, mirrored black-box in `docs/hwref`):
  `q35`/`kvm`, `host,vmx=off,svm=off` (plus the Hyper-V enlightenments and
  the kvm-pit global for windows on this AVIC host), SeaBIOS or the OVMF
  pflash pair, virtio-serial `vmlab.agent.0`, one qcow2 overlay on
  virtio-blk (SeaBIOS bootindex), one stream-netdev virtio-net NIC,
  virtio-vga, `-usb` + usb-tablet, `-S` then QMP `cont`.
- **vmlab-hv** — the same machine as a machine description, every device
  at the PCI function QEMU auto-assigns for that argv (00:01.0 console,
  00:02.0 blk, 00:03.0 net, 00:04.0 vga, 00:05.0 the xHCI that replaces
  QEMU's ICH9 USB set, D6; AHCI at 00:1f.2 as on q35), launched `--paused`
  and released with a control-socket `resume`. The NIC carries the
  separately built iPXE ROM (D16) where QEMU loads its own combo ROM.

The host side of the segment is `bench/netpeer.c` (`netpeer peer`:
  ARP responder, byte counter, on-command blaster; `netpeer hub`:
  two-port pump), built on demand into `bench/run/bin/`.

## Noise control

- **Pinning**: the VM process tree runs under `taskset -c` on full physical
  cores in the top half of the topology (smp1 → e.g. `16-19`, smp4 →
  `16-23` on the 32-thread host this was written on; `--cpus` overrides).
  Every backend gets the same window. The g2g pair pins one VM per half
  (`16-19` + `20-23`) so the two never contend.
- **Recorded per run**: cpufreq governor, load average (start and end of
  each repeat), pin window, memory cap, template version, backend version,
  host CPU count, git commit (with dirty marker), and for x86_64 the APIC
  virtualisation fact, the NIC MTU and the block tool actually used.
- **Repeats**: N per configuration (default 3); the history stores the
  samples, the median, and the max-min spread.
- **Safety**: at most two VMs at a time (only the g2g pair), always inside
  `systemd-run --user --scope -p MemoryMax=24G -p MemorySwapMax=0`, always
  reaped (group kill plus a run-path sweep) even on failure.

## History

One JSON line per (backend, arch, guest, vcpus, workload) per run, appended
to `bench/history/<arch>.jsonl`; the file is committed, so the trend
survives. Fields:

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `recorded` | ISO timestamp of the aggregated entry |
| `commit`, `dirty` | worktree commit the suite ran from |
| `host` | hostname |
| `backend` | `qemu` or `vmlab-hv` |
| `arch`, `guest`, `vcpus`, `workload`, `unit`, `direction` | the configuration; `direction` says which way is a regression (`lower` for seconds and CPU %, `higher` for rates) |
| `repeats`, `samples` | N and the raw values |
| `median`, `spread` | median and max-min of the samples |
| `qemu_baseline` | on `vmlab-hv` lines: the newest same-config QEMU record (median, spread, commit, recorded); `null` on `qemu` lines |
| `env` | the noise-control record above |

`bench-check` compares, per configuration, the latest entry with the
previous one **of the same backend**, and fails when the median moved by
more than the noise **in the workload's worse direction**: the larger of
the two spreads, or 5 % of the previous median. Cross-backend comparison
is the phase bar; `bench-report` prints the hv/qemu ratio against it
(TCG ≥ 1.00x, x86_64 boot ≤ 1.00x and throughput ≥ 0.80x) rather than
gating on it, because the bar gates flipping a default, not every commit.

## Profiling hooks

The suite runs backends with the ambient environment, so the emulator's
switches (interpreter-only, block counts, JIT perf maps) reach the VM by
setting them before `bench-run`; each run directory under `bench/run/`
(gitignored) keeps `serial.log`, `stderr.log` and `result.json` with every
raw timing, and `--keep` also preserves the overlay and vars so a run can be
inspected post mortem.
