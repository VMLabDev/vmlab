# AGENTS.md

`vmlab-hv` is an MIT-licensed Rust hypervisor that vmlab
in this repository runs one process per machine, in place of QEMU.

## Before you change anything

For repository layout, workspace dependencies, builds and gates, read
`docs/adr/0022-import-the-hypervisor-into-the-vmlab-workspace.md` from the
repository root. It supersedes the older plans' separate-repository layout
and git dependency decisions.

Read the specification at
`hv/docs/plans/vmlab-hypervisor/SPEC.md` (from the repository root). It is
the contract. A `Dn` reference points at a decision row in `MAP.md`, in the same
directory. Its reasoning is in `notes/`, which you open only when the outcome
alone is not enough. When the spec and your task brief disagree, follow the spec
and say so in your report.

## Crates

- `vmlab-hv`: the binary. Parses `--machine`, `--control`, `--paused` and wires the VMM.
- `vmlab-hv-proto`: the machine description and the control protocol. vmlab depends on it.
- `vmlab-disk`: the `DiskImage` seam, the raw and qcow2 implementations, and the image operations in `ops`. vmlab depends on it.
- `vmlab-hv-devices`: device models written against the traits in its `lib.rs` (`BusDevice`, `PciDevice`, `VirtioDevice`, `IrqLine`, `MsiSink`, `Snapshot`). They know nothing about KVM.
- `vmlab-hv-vmm`: KVM, guest memory, vCPUs, the buses, the machine model, the control server, and snapshot orchestration.

Shared traits and types are the interface between parallel work. If one needs
to change, make the smallest change that works, and name it in your report.

## Sources and licence

Implement from specifications first: the VIRTIO 1.2 spec, Intel and AMD
manuals, the ACPI spec, the qcow2 spec, the Linux boot protocol, and the
rust-vmm crate docs. Running QEMU or `qemu-img` to observe behaviour is the
usual way to pin what QEMU presents.

Reading QEMU's C source as a reference is allowed, for example to settle how a
device behaves. Writing the Rust is still your own work: never copy QEMU code
or translate it line by line. QEMU is GPLv2 and this project is MIT, so copied
or mechanically translated code would change the project's licence.

Code lifted from crosvm keeps its BSD-3 header and gets a line in
the repository-root `THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES`. Apache-2.0 crates are used as dependencies only.

## Finishing a task

A task is done when all three hold:

1. From the repository root, `just ci::check` passes the light merge bar. The lead runs the guest-booting `just ci::hv-gate` before release e2e, and a nightly workflow runs it on `next` (see `docs/agents/hv-gate.md`). Individual agents do not run it.
2. Every `unimplemented!()` or `todo!()` inside your task's scope has been replaced by working code with tests.
3. The behaviour your task owns is proven by a test at the seam the spec names for it: S1 (the `vmlab-hv` control socket) or S2 (`vmlab-disk` against `qemu-img`). Device unit tests sit below those seams and do not replace them.

Commit on your own branch with conventional-commit messages (`feat(disk): ...`).
Add no co-author trailers. End with a report that lists what works, what you
verified and how, any shared interface you changed, and anything left
unfinished, with the reason.
