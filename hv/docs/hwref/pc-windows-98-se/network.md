# network observations

Counts cover the full trace stream, including lines omitted from the bounded raw log.
Addresses retain QEMU trace notation. Use `mtree.txt` to interpret regions and aliases.
A range in the value column includes every integer between its endpoints.
Aperture rows combine framebuffer byte addresses; they are not indexed register decodes.
Physical-memory snapshots can add observer reads to legacy VGA aperture rows.
Those aperture counts are not guest-only counts. Host fw_cfg inventory reads are excluded.
First use is the 1-based line number across all enabled events, including firmware.

## Register accesses

| Region or event | Address or index | Operation | Bytes | Count | First use | Values |
|---|---|---|---:|---:|---:|---|

## Device events

| Event | Count | First use |
|---|---:|---:|
| `pcnet_s_reset` | 1 | 9 |

Normalized argument samples, command opcodes, and truncation flags are in `event-values.json`.
Event counts and register counts can overlap because device-specific and memory-region tracing observe the same access.
Samples are limited to 256 distinct argument strings per event. They do not prove absence of later argument variants.
